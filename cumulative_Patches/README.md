# Aggregated Patches Across APR Tools

In this section, we focus on aggregating the patches generated by various APR tools, each of which has been individually examined to assess the effectiveness of our ranking system.

Our current approach combines patches from multiple sources - specifically Cardumen, Jaid, and RapidCapr - for each bug. This aggregation will enable us to comprehensively analyze the patches across different tools and observe the effectiveness of our ranking methodology in a more unified context.
